# RoboPhiloEZB4adapter

You can find this thing on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3621120

I made this in 2015, so it's not fresh on my memory.


This is an adapter to let you mount an EZRobot EZB-4 to a RoboPhilo. 
 The controller board is still available today, but I'm not sure about 
the robot.


This was an attempt for me to get this robot working.  The original 
controller board had issues (probably the software), so I could never 
get the robot to do much.  After getting this adapter plate finalized, I
 still had issues with software, though it might be operator error.  As 
you can see, it's been a few years since i last played with this.


You will need to replace the existing mounting plate with this one.  
You should be able to use the previous screws, but you might need to 
shave away at (chamfer?) the screw holes.
